"""Regression tests for the style gate and the commit-msg hook beside it,
each one a fault that shipped.

The gate is the most-copied tool in the workspace -- thirteen projects
carry it and every commit in fourteen runs it -- and until 2026-08-28 it
had no tests at all. Both lexer faults fuzznet reported in August reached
every copy before anything caught them, and the floor redesign shipped on
fixture runs done by hand in a scratch directory. A tool this shared
cannot keep being verified by whoever happens to be editing it.

Every test here names the incident that produced it, because a fixture
whose reason is lost gets deleted the next time it is inconvenient. Run
with `make test`, which is wired to fail the build; the suite needs
nothing beyond the standard library and the gate itself.
