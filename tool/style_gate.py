"""The indentation and whitespace gate for private projects.

One tool, merged from three that had grown apart:

  fuzzypickles/tools/tabify.py    the C/C++ fixer (brace-nesting lexer)
  beerssh/tools/tabify.py         a copy of it, drifted in the docstring only
  */tools/check-indent.sh         file enumeration plus the collapse floor
  situ/tools/lint_conventions.py  the checker: ASCII, tabs, trailing space,
                                  final newline, with a tokenize-based
                                  exemption for Python string literals
                                  (C/C++ literals are exempt here too, by a
                                  scanner written for the purpose)

The two tabify.py copies were byte-identical in code and differed only in
their docstrings, which is the cheap kind of drift. The two check-indent.sh
copies had genuinely diverged -- different discovery, different scope,
different floor -- and both were right for their own tree, which is why
those differences are configuration here rather than a winner.

A fourth capability existed in none of them: fixing Python. tabify.py's
lexer counts braces and cannot see a Python block, so apt-emerge's
conversion was done by a throwaway script. That approach is folded in.

Every fixer carries a proof rather than a promise:

  C/C++   expanding leading tabs back to `indent_width` columns must give
          the original file. Only leading whitespace is ever rewritten.
  Python  the AST must be identical before and after. ast.dump() without
          attributes is position-free but carries every string constant,
          so an identical dump means no block and no literal moved.

A fixer that cannot prove its own edit refuses to write it.

Usage:
    style_gate.py check [--root DIR] [PATH...]
    style_gate.py fix   [--root DIR] PATH...
    style_gate.py list  [--root DIR]      # what would be checked, and why
    style_gate.py docs  [--root DIR]      # hold project.md to the tree

Configuration is `.style-gate.toml` at the project root; every key is
optional. See DEFAULTS below for the meaning and the shipped values.

	matching. Reported as success that is the worst outcome available: a gate
	that has stopped looking is indistinguishable from a clean tree and stays
	that way until somebody thinks to doubt it.

	`floor` takes two shapes, and the difference is what it stays true
	against:

	- **A fraction (0 < floor < 1)**: the gated count must be at least that
	  share of the RAW population -- every path git lists before the
	  excludes, the include prefixes and the extension selection run. Those
	  filters are exactly what a bad edit collapses, so the baseline sits
	  upstream of every failure this check exists to catch, and it moves
	  with the tree: a floor of 0.3 chosen when 239 of 800 files were gated
	  is still 0.3 when the tree is twice the size. Measured across
	  fourteen projects before this existed, the absolute form had decayed
	  to between 22% and 80% of the real count -- every number right on the
	  day it was written, wrong later, and silent about it, because a floor
	  that is too low fails by passing.

	- **A whole number**: the old absolute form, kept so an un-migrated
	  config keeps its protection. It catches a collapse; what it cannot do
	  is stay calibrated as the tree grows.

	Neither shape polices a number: adding files never requires touching
	either. And neither promises to catch a single module dropping out --
	that needs a floor within one module of the real count, which fires on
	every legitimate addition. What a floor catches is a collapse. The
	advice that once claimed the finer catch claimed more than any floor
	can deliver.

	A raw population of zero is judged before either shape, because it is
	the one input both are blind to. `count < floor * 0` is `0 < 0`, which
	is False, so the fractional form passed precisely the case this
	docstring names -- the pathspec, the glob or the git call having
	stopped matching -- and was strictly weaker there than the absolute
	form it replaced. Found with a truncated .git/index, where `check`
	printed "0 files conform" and exited 0. discover() now refuses a
	failing git before this is reached, but a floor that only holds
	because some other check closed the door is not a floor.

		The measurement that settled it: across the fifteen projects, of the
		94 places a gated C or C++ file opens a namespace, 94 write the
		contents flush and none indents them. (A first count said one tree
		indented 576 times and another once; the 576 were vendored files no
		gate reads, and the one was this scanner reading a block comment's
		` *` continuation as indentation. Both were the instrument.)

		What it cost is the reason to record it rather than just fix it.
		`code-style.md`'s own worked example for this rule conformed when
		saved verbatim and reported two violations when a namespace was
		wrapped round it -- so the document and the tool that enforces it
		disagreed, and the trees had been converted to the tool's answer.
		A rule learned from the tool rather than from the document is the
		wrong way round.

	Both document checks read prose, and neither could tell prose from a
	fenced example until this existed: a shell comment starts at column 0
	exactly as a heading does, and an illustrated markdown table has rows
	starting with `|` exactly as a real one does. A `# build the thing`
	appearing twice in one block was reported as a repeated heading, and a
	fenced table naming `tool/nope.py` as a missing file -- the second only
	when the illustrated path's parent directory exists, which is why it
	hid.

	**Only a CLOSED fence hides anything, and the first version of this
	got that wrong in the direction that matters.** It toggled on every
	marker, so a lone one swallowed the rest of the file. fuzznet's
	project.md carries a single `~~~~` at line 6474 as a horizontal rule,
	with no partner anywhere: the heading count fell from 1086 to 99, and
	993 headings and every path across the remaining 22,765 lines left the
	gate without a word. That is the fault this whole function exists to
	remove, reintroduced by the function -- and it was caught by comparing
	the two gates across sixteen trees before spreading either, not by
	review.

	So pairing is required, and an unmatched marker is ordinary text. The
	worst case is then a genuinely unterminated fence whose contents get
	read as prose, which is the behaviour before any of this and cannot
	hide anything. A closing run must be the same character and no shorter
	than the opening one, and must hold nothing else -- an info string is
	allowed only on the opener, which is what lets ```sh open and ``` close.

	Table rows only, and deliberately: a path in a table is a CLAIM about
	the tree, while a path in prose is as often an example, a glob, a
	layout being described, or a file that does not exist yet. Measured
	across seventeen documents 2026-09-01: 128 backticked paths sit in
	table rows and 1625 sit in prose, of which only 617 name a file that
	is there. Widening this to prose would mean judging about a thousand
	tokens that are not meant to be files, which is the flood the caller's
	own "describing a layout rather than pointing at a file" guard exists
	to avoid.

	So a document whose tables hold no paths has a path half that
	inspects NOTHING, and that is a documentation style rather than a
	fault. Three of the seventeen are in that state on 2026-09-03 --
	beerssh, openmlx4 and hembygd -- and none of them could have been
	known to be, because until the count was printed beside the verdict a
	gate checking 233 headings and 0 paths said exactly what a gate
	checking both would say. Found by fuzzypickles on the first run after
	the count landed, in their own tree, which is the case for printing a
	population rather than a verdict.

	"Whose tables hold no paths" is the condition, and it is NOT "has no
	table" -- which is how this said it, and the difference cost a wrong
	claim. All three have tables: beerssh 149 rows, openmlx4 25,
	hembygd 23. What they lack is a table that inventories paths; theirs
	are field/value and option tables, and beerssh's two slash-bearing
	tokens are `-h/--help` and `-v/--version`, refused by the guard
	below for the leading dash. A reader who takes the old wording
	literally greps for a table, finds 149, and concludes this function
	is broken. One did, and wrote it into a commit message."""

	"""Find Rust doc comments that open with a bare `///` and so have no summary.

	Rust's convention, and rustdoc's rendering, take the first line of a doc
	comment as the summary: it is what the module index shows beside the item
	and what a reader sees first. A comment that opens with an empty `///`
	has none, so the rendered page for the item begins with a heading --
	`# Errors`, usually, because that is the section a public function is
	obliged to carry.

	`missing_docs` cannot see this. The comment is present; it just says
	nothing before its first section, which is how one sat on a public
	function in netcfgd until its 0223 went looking. The rule is netcfgd's,
	from its 2775190, taken into the source 2026-09-15 because a copy
	carrying a rule the source lacks is a copy `sync` erases.

	**This is worth a gate where the run-together case is not.** That one --
	two doc comments with no item between them -- has no exact textual
	signature, and the lint that would catch it,
	`clippy::missing_docs_in_private_items`, reported 447 items in the tree
	that measured it. This one is a single unambiguous pattern: a `///` line
	whose predecessor is not a doc comment, and which carries nothing after
	the slashes. `////` and longer are separators, not doc comments, and are
	left alone.

	The population is the gate's own, not a walk: `files` is what discover()
	kept, so the tree's excludes and git's ignore rules apply, and a vendored
	submodule is a gitlink rather than a directory of `.rs` files. The copy
	this came from walked `rglob` and named its build and vendor directories
